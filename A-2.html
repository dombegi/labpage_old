			<h3>Plasma Energy Engineering and Science</h3>
			<p>Ohno Laboratory was established in 1988 under Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan for advanced research and education in the field of Plasma Science. </p>
			<p>The mission and vision of the laboratory is to provide extensive research in the field of Nuclear Fusion and Plasma Sciences to enhance the technology and to meet the increasing demands of future energy sources. </p>
			<p>Currently the laboratory is providing outstanding opportunities for researcher in order to do their research including Fusion Related Plasma Science and Basic Plasma Science such as Tokamak Physics, RF Plasma Heating and Plasma-Surface Interaction; Plasma Processing; High Pressure RF Plasmas and their Industrial Applications. </p>
			<p>The Laboratory accepts bachelor students graduated from various departments of electrical related engineering and physics with excellent result. The research program provides graduate students with the ability to explore their knowledge to solve the increasing energy problems in the world. Recently one foreign graduate student (now serving military service in his country) and one assistant professor along with about 15 Japanese students and 4 staff members are working in the lab.</p>
